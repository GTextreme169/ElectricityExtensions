# Electricity Extensions
This repo is a collection of extensions for the [Electricity Mod](https://mods.vintagestory.at/electricity).
These are features that I wanted to add to the mod, but didn't want to clutter the main mod with.
This mod is required on both client and server.

## Features 
**(Checkboxes mean that the feature is implemented)**
- [x] **Smarter Electric Forge**: Adds a new Electric Forge that only uses electricity when it's actually smelting something. 
  - Called "Electric Forge (Sensor)"
- [X] **Conductor Block**: This is a feature applies to all metal blocks, it allows them to conduct electricity.
- [X] **Electric Oven**: Modified Fire pit that uses electricity instead of fuel. 
  - Called "Electric Oven"
  - I have not been able to get the animations to work yet.
- [ ] **Electric Farmland**: Similar to Farmland, but heats the soil to help with winter. 
  - Called "Electric Farmland"
  - This block is very buggy, and I have not been able to get it to work reliably yet.


## Installation
1. Install the [Electricity Mod](https://mods.vintagestory.at/electricity)
2. Download the Matching Version of the Electricity Extensions
