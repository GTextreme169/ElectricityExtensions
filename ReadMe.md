# Electricity Extensions
This repo is a collection of extensions for the [Electricity Mod](https://mods.vintagestory.at/electricity).
These are features that I wanted to add to the mod, but didn't want to clutter the main mod with.
This mod is required on both client and server.

## Features 
**(Checkboxes mean that the feature is implemented)**
- [x] **Smarter Electric Forge**: Adds a new Electric Forge that only uses electricity when it's actually smelting something. 
  - Called "Electric Forge (Sensor)"
- [ ] **Electric Block**: Adds a block to pass wired electricity through walls. 
  - This is a feature that I was able to apply to all metal blocks, but have not been successful in running it without modifying the base mod.)
- [ ] **Electric Furnace**: Modified Fire pit that uses electricity instead of fuel. 
  - Called "Electric Furnace"
  - I have not finished the shape for this block yet.
- [ ] **Electric Farmland**: Similar to Farmland, but heats the soil to help with winter. 
  - Called "Electric Farmland"
  - This block is very buggy, and I have not been able to get it to work reliably yet.
